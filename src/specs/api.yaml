        Results from work performed by workers are relayed to the API through this endpoint.

        Note that this endpoint is only exposed to AWS SNS, and since it has a specific communication protocol with limited feedback, the schema defined here is designed to be liberally enforceable. This endpoint is also used by SNS to handle subscribe/unsubscribe events.

        The actual JSON passed by SNS is found in the `WorkResponse` model, which is to be validated by the API.
