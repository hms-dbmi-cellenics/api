title: Batch Differential Expression
type: object
description: |-
  Runs batch differential expression requests for each cluster in a chosen cell set. The functional behavior of this task shall be as follows:

  (1) The cells in the experiment should be subset by the cell set specified in `basis`. Differential expression should only be run on cell that are in the `basis` cell set.
  (2) Differential expression should be run on two cell sets, as specified in `cellSet` and `compareWith`.

    type: string
    description: The name of this work -- must be `BatchDifferentialExpression`.
    pattern: BatchDifferentialExpression
  basis:
    type: array
    description: |-
      An array of cellSets to run batch differential expression for
  cellSet:
    type: array
    description: One or more cell sets differential expression is run for. This must be a valid UUID of a cell set as found in the DB.
  compareWith:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The second cell set to compare against. This may be another cell set UUID, `rest`, or `background`.

      If it is a UUID, the comparison is made between the UUID in `cellSet` and the UUID specified here.

      If it is `rest`, the comparison is made between the UUID in `cellSet` and all remaning cells under the same cell set hierarchy (e.g. scratchpad).

      If it is `background`, the comparison is made between the UUID in `cellSet` and all other cells in the experiment.
  comparisonType:
    type: string
    enum:
      - between
      - within
    description: |-
      The comparison type that is chosen. This can be  `within` or `between`.

      `within` signifies that the comparison is done between clusters within a group.

      `between` signifies that the comparison is between groups within a cluster.
